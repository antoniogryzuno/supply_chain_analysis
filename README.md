# ASIA SUPPLY CHAIN AND MARKETING PROJECT 

## INTRODUCTION 
Our team of Supply Chain Analysts has been assigned the crucial task of scrutinizing the sales and logistics operations of an Asian retailer, which faced a decline in sales from 2016 to 2018. With the objective of enhancing future marketing campaigns, reducing logistics costs, and bolstering sales figures, I have chosen to analyze the period from 2015 to 2018.

## ANALYSIS POINTS 

### ABOUT THE PROJECT
"Asia Supply Chain and Marketing" is an exploratory and optimization project designed for a big retailer (name remains anonymous), which manufactures a wide range of products in Asia and fulfills orders for customers in the United States and South America. The company employs various types of delivery shipment and transportation modes to meet client requirements.

### FOR WHO? 
Supply Chain, Marketing and Financial Departments

### WHY? 
The decrease in sales after 2016 presented a significant opportunity to investigate the issue and make recommendations for future marketing campaigns, supply chain optimization, and the identification of new financial opportunities.

### WHAT WILL BE DONE? 
Quantitative and qualitative analyses will be conducted to address several research questions. Additionally, a brief regression analysis will be performed to determine if there is a correlation between price and sales.

### WHEN? 
The data will be analyzed specifically for the four years with decreasing sales (2015-2018), providing valuable insights for future marketing and supply chain strategies.

### WHERE? 
The data analysis will be conducted using Jupyter (Python) and Tableau to leverage their capabilities for comprehensive exploration and visualization.
